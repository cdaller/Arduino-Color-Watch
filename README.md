# Arduino Color Watch using a Neo Pixel Ring

This arduino project uses a neo pixel ring from adafruit for a color watch. It uses a different color for every hour 
and shows the minutes of the full hour in a different color.

So the minutes are relatively easy to see, but for the hour color-blindness is a no-go :-)
